Let it Burn Game change log

2017-05-09
	- Created readme, changelog, and todo.
	- Status: Classes tile, map, coord, coord_set finished. Main able to read in floor plan file.
	
2017-05-09
	- Added "Player" class.
	- Added functionality to player class initialization, four "move" functions, and "get_mask" function.
		- Note: "move" functions will return int of position changed for "game" class to evaluate against the map edges.
		
2017-05-10
	- Changed player class. move functions no longer return int. Instead, "game" class checks potential next tile for condition, then evaluates if player can move onto it.
	
2017-05-11
	- game class "move_player()" now checks if player is at bounds or if he is up against a wall.
		- Must add checks so player can't move onto fire, closed doors, or smoke without a smoke mask.
		- Must add ability for player to open closed doors. Takes one turn to open door.
		- requires testing.
	- game class "print_map()" now displays player location.
		- requires testing.
	- Added functionality for "move_player()" to check for fire, damaged walls, and closed doors.
	- "move_player()" now opens closed doors. (Takes one turn to open doors.)
	
2017-05-12
	- "move_player()" function in "game" class now checks for smoke mask on player and allows movement through smoked tiles.
	- "tile" objects now have a boolean to denote if they have a smoke mask on them. Relevant functions for setting and getting this bool have also been implemented.
		- Masks are initialized when the board and tile are loaded.
			- Add way to place new masks on tiles.
	- "game" class fuction "move_player()" now changes player mask bool when picking up a mask, as well as removing mask from the tile after they have been picked up.
	- "game" class fuction "print_map()" now checks if a tile has a mask and prints an identifier accordingly.
	
2017-05-13
	- added game class initializer which only has two ints, one for size x and one for size y. "user" is initialized to (0,0).
	- Fixed game initializers to correctly initialize player "user."
	
2017-05-14
	- Changed player class to return bool for main to interpret instead of printing an requesting new input itself.
	- Added exit bool to tiles which indicates if the tile is an exit. Added relevant functions for setting and getting exit status.
	- Changed player::print_map() to display exit tiles on print.
	- After testing player movement, redid game::move_player() to correctly check bounds and obstructions.
	- Changed game::print_map() to display the map elements in a continuous manner.
	
2017-05-16
	- Added functions to "player" class to allow setting of pos_x and pos_y variables.
	- Added functions to "tile" class to set a tile as an exit or as a mask.
	- Changed Main's "floorplan reading" section to read positions for exit tiles, masks, and player start tiles.
		- Exit tiles are marked as cond 100.
		- Mask tiles are marked as cond 1000.
		- Player start tiles are marked as cond 10000.
	- Changed "game::move_player()" to return an int which signifies the condition:
		- returns 0 if the player has not moved.
		- returns 1 if the player has moved.
		- returns 2 if the player has moved onto an exit tile.
	- Changed main's "player movement" phase to accomodate the above changes.
	- Added exit dialouge to be displayed when the player reaches an exit tile.
	- Changed floorplan reader from using old "fp_line[0]-'0'" method of setting conditions to using "atoi()" function with space searching.
		- Necessary because the old method could not handle numbers greater than nine.
	- Began refactoring code to remove extraneous functions and inclusions.
		- Refactored "tile" and "coord" class.
	
2017-05-17
	- Continued refactoring classes.
		- Refactored "coord_set" and "map" classes.
		- Refactored "player" class.
		- Refactored "game" class and main.
	
2017-05-18
	- Changed "game::print_map()" to return a string.
		- Changed main to correctly display the returned string.
